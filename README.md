# Relational-Databases

 Relational Databases have more than one table and are linked using fields and represented with keys. **Information is meaningful data that has been structured or processed.**
 
 ### Entity relationships
 
 An entity is a category of object, person, event or thing of interest about which data needs to be recorded. Each entity in a database can have attributes. E.g Member(title, firstname, surname, email, etc)

- Redundancy
- Update Issues (more than 1 place)
- Deletion issues (more than 1 place)
